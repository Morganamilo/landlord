# Landlord
Landlord is a cool text-based puzzle and tactic game. The game is in *early alpha* so be accepting of any bugs or glitches.
#### Building
There are two ways to build it
1) Run the makefile which will do it all for you
  'make'
2) Make build script executable then run it
2a) Make executable
  'chmod +x build.sh'
2b) Run build script
  './build.sh'
Done!
#### Running
On linux simply run './landlord.out' after building it!
On windows just double click the landlord.exe file!
