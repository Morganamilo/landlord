# Landlord
Landlord is a cool text-based puzzle and tactic game. The game is in **early alpha** so be accepting of any bugs or glitches.
#### Building
There are two ways to build it
1) Run the makefile which will do it all for you
  `make`
2) Make build script executable `chmod +x build.sh` then run it `./build.sh`
Done!
#### Running
On linux simply run `./landlord.out` after building it!
On windows just double click the landlord.exe file!
